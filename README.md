Prediction of user socio-demographic characteristics

Problem Description
On the RUTUBE platform, users do not always provide their data, such as age and gender. This creates challenges in forming an accurate user profile and developing personalized recommendations. As a result, the platform's ability to deliver content that best matches users' interests and needs is limited, negatively impacting their experience.

Solution
It is necessary to develop a model that can predict a user's gender and age based on their viewing history. The obtained data will serve as important features for enhancing the recommendation system, as well as for more effective content search and moderation on the platform.
